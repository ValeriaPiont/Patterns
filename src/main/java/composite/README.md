# Composite pattern 

### Description
It is a structural design pattern. A composite design pattern allows to build a
tree-like structure of objects and to treat individual types of those objects uniformly (using polymorphism, all implementing
classes conform to the same interface).

Apply the design principles of decomposition and generalization.

### Goal & Use for

● To compose nested structures of objects
● To deal with the classes for these objects uniforml
