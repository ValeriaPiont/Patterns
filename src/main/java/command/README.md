# Command Pattern

### Description
Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object of
its own. In general, when an object makes a request for a
second object to do an action, the first object would call a
method of the second object and the second object would
complete the task. There is direct communication between the
sender and receiver object.

### Goal & Use for
