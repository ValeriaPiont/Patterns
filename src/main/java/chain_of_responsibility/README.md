# Chain of Responsibility pattern 

### Description
The chain of responsibility design pattern is a chain of objects that are responsible for handling requests. These objects are handler objects that are linked together.

### Goal & Use for

‚óè Avoids coupling the sender to the receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request.

#### -------------
This pattern is similar to exception handling in Java. In exception
handling, a series of try/catch blocks are written in your software to
ensure that exceptions are dealt with properly. When an exception
occurs, one of the catch blocks is expected to handle it.
