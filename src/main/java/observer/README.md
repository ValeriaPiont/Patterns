# Observer pattern 

### Description
The observer design pattern is a pattern where a subject
keeps a list of observers. Observers rely on the subject to
inform them of changes to the state of the subject.

In an observer design pattern, there is generally a Subject
superclass, which would have an attribute to keep track of all
the observers.
